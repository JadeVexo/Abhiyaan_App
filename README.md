<strong>Why I want to work in the team:</strong>
I have a passion for software dev/Robotics/Computer Vision/AI etc. So I joined an Autonomous Drone project in CFI ibot. While I was there I was watching the Abhiyaan team work on their project for openhouse. This was very much in tuned to what I wanted to do in the future. I was very facinated with the work and the dedication that the team was showing to get a working product. This was a major motivation for me to apply to the team. Naturally, I was waiting around for the application to roll out and here I am.
